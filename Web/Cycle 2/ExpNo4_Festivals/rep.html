<h2>Republic Day</h2>
</font>
<p>
Republic Day, in India, national holiday celebrated annually to commemorate the adoption of the constitution of India on January 26, 1950. It differs from Independence Day, which annually commemorates the end of British rule on August 15, 1947, and which stemmed from the Indian Independence Act of July 18, 1947.

<p>
The Indian Independence Act transferred legislative authority to the Constituent Assembly, which established a committee, chaired by the law minister Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, to draft the constitution. A draft was submitted in November to the Constituent Assembly, which publicly debated and adjusted the text over the following two years. January 26 was selected as the date of the constitution’s promulgation in recognition of the Purna Swaraj resolution, a call for India’s complete independence adopted by the Indian National Congress on January 26, 1930. The constitution, one of the longest and most detailed in the world, established India as a democratic republic and a union of states.
