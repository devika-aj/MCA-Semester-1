Tree is a tall plant that can live for a very long time. It has a single stem or trunk and branches that support leaves. Beneath the ground, a tree has a root system that acts as an anchor and stores the water and nutrients the plant needs to grow.

One of the ways we distinguish trees from other plants is their thick and rigid ligneous tissues, which we know as wood. And of course, different tree species are made up of different types of wood.

Ultimately, while it's useful to have a basic tree definition, as with all nature we need to delve deeper to understand the sheer variety of trees in the forest.
